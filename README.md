# Car Accident Death Insurance Prediction System

This repository contains a **machine learning–based prediction system** designed to estimate the **risk of fatal outcomes in car accidents** for insurance-related decision making. The project aims to support **insurance agents and analysts** by providing data-driven insights for risk assessment and policy evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The objectives of this project are:

- To predict the **likelihood of death** in car accident scenarios using historical data.
- To assist **insurance companies** in assessing accident severity and claim risk.
- To demonstrate the application of **machine learning in real-world insurance analytics**.
- To provide an interpretable and deployable predictive system.

## 🚗 Problem Context

Insurance companies rely on risk estimation to determine:
- Premium pricing
- Claim evaluation
- Policy eligibility

Manual assessment can be inconsistent and subjective.  
This project introduces a **machine learning–driven approach** to predict fatal accident risk using relevant accident and vehicle-related parameters.
